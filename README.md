# College-Enrollment-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of college enrollment demographics using a dynamic data management and visualization approach. By creating a MySQL database to store the enrollment dataset and utilizing Tableau for interactive visualizations, this project aims to provide real-time insights into the demographic distribution of students based on gender and ethnic origin.

## Data Visualization (Tableau)

### Dashboards

1. **Male Population Analysis:**
   - **Description:** This dashboard visualizes the distribution of the male population across different education levels and ethnic groups.
   - **Key Features:** Tree plots representing education levels and bubble density indicating population size. Bar charts show the ethnic distribution of male students.

2. **Female Population Analysis:**
   - **Description:** This dashboard visualizes the distribution of the female population across different education levels and ethnic groups.
   - **Key Features:** Similar to the male analysis, this dashboard includes tree plots and bar charts to represent the demographic distribution of female students.

### Analysis Insights

- **Male Population:**
  - Higher density near the outer rings of the tree plot indicates a larger male population at undergraduate levels compared to graduate levels.
  - White men have the highest representation, with minority groups like Hispanic and African American men having lower enrollment numbers, especially in graduate programs.

- **Female Population:**
  - Similar trends are observed for the female population, with higher enrollment at the undergraduate level.
  - White women dominate the enrollment statistics, with lower representation from minority groups in graduate programs.


## Project Structure

1. **Database Creation and Management:**
   - **Objective:** Establish a robust database to manage the college enrollment dataset efficiently.
   - **Tool Used:** MySQL
   - **Details:** The dataset was imported into a MySQL database to enable efficient querying and management.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - **Objective:** Create dynamic and interactive visualizations to analyze and present the enrollment data.
   - **Tool Used:** Tableau
   - **Details:** Tableau was connected to the MySQL database to enable real-time updates and dynamic data interactions. Two dashboards were created to visualize the enrollment demographics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **MySQL:** Used to create and manage the database, and to handle data imports and queries.
- **Tableau:** Used for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards that reflect real-time data updates.
